[PwnMe](https://pwnme.fr/) is a CTF created by students of the [2600 school](https://ecole2600.com) for students.

The qualifications for the 2023 edition took place from May 5th to May 7th, 2023.

Among the categories offered (Web / Reverse / Forensic / OSINT / Pwn and Crypto), I chose to focus on the Web and OSINT challenges.

**Below, by category, are the write-ups for the challenges I successfully solved.**
